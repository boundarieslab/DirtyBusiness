<h1>About Dirty Business</h1>

<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>Dirty Business is an independent research project mapping mass waste management facilities and landfills across Norway. This platform documents the infrastructure and corporate networks involved in handling excavated soil from construction projects.</p>

<h2>Why does it matter?</h2>
<p>Construction projects in Norway generate millions of cubic meters of excavated soil annually. Where does it all go? Who profits? What are the environmental consequences? This project aims to make this invisible infrastructure visible.</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>Data is collected from:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Public permit applications and environmental impact assessments</li>
    <li>Miljødirektoratet's databases</li>
    <li>Municipal planning documents</li>
    <li>Satellite imagery and aerial photography</li>
    <li>Field visits and documentation</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to use this map</h2>
